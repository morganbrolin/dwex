### Added

- `HexCellData` struct that bundles cell flags, values, and coordinates.

### Changed

### Added

- `HexCellSearchData` struct that bundles data used when searching cells.

### Changed

- Upgraded to Unity 2022.3.20f1, URP 14.0.10, and Burst 1.8.11.
- Cell search data and visibility are stored in arrays in `HexGrid` instead of per `HexCell`.
- `HexCellPriorityQueue` works with cell indices instead of `HexCell` references.
- `HexCellPriorityQueue`, `HexCellShaderData`, and `HexMapGenerator` rely on `HexGrid` for cell search data and visibility.

## [3.1.0] - 2023-12-14

### Added

- `HexValues` struct that packs seven values of `HexCell` in 32 bits.

### Changed

- Upgraded to Unity 2022.3.15f1 and Burst 1.8.11.
- Limited C# code line width to 80.
- Methods that weren't used outside `HexCell` are now private.
- Loading and saving code moved from `HexCell` to `HexValues` and `HexFlags`.
- More `HexCell` simplification.
- HLSL code uses same code style as C#.

### Removed

- Unused debug method `SetMapData` from `HexCell` and `HexCellShaderData`.

### Fixed

- Replaced custom *Terrain Texture Array* asset with imported texture array PNG.
- Code style modernization.
- Make use of `SetLocalPositionAndRotation` in `HexFeatureManager`.
- Replaced all `HexCell` lists and fields that have to survive hot reloads with indices, except `HexGrid.cells`.
- `HexCell` has become a serializable class that no longer extends `MonoBehavior`.

### Removed

- Unused `originalViewElevation` local variable in `HexCell.Elevation` and `HexCell.WaterLevel` setters.
- Unused `direction` parameter from `HexGridChunk.TriangulateWithRiverBeginOrEnd` method.
- `HexCell.ShaderData` property.
- Separate terrain textures and custom texture array asset.
- *AI Navigation* package.

- `HexCell.Grid` property, which is used to retrieve neighbor cells.
- `HexCell.HasIncomingRiverThroughEdge` method.
- `HexCell.TryGetNeighbor` and `HexGrid.TryGetCell` methods, to make cell retrieval more efficient and convenient.
- `HexCoordinates.Step` method, to help retrieve cell neighbors based on coordinates.

### Changed

- Upgraded to Unity 2021.3.24f1 and URP 12.1.11.
- Started changing code style to newer tutorial style, more like standard C# style.

### Removed

- `HexCell` neighbors and roads arrays.

## [2.2.0] - 2023-03-10

### Added

- Store world-space water level in B channel of shader data.
- Colorize underwater terrain based on submergence.
- Highlight affected cells while in edit mode, based on cursor position and brush size.
- The concept of hex space, where the distance between cell centers of east-west neighbors is one unit.
- Documentation page to showcase feature-level changes visible to players.

### Changed

- Upgraded to Unity 2021.3.20f1 and URP 12.1.10.
- *HexCellData.hlsl* relies upon and includes *HexMetrics.hlsl*.
- `HexCellShaderData` uses a separate boolean array to track visibility transitions.
- Shaders use world position XZ to calculate hex grid position data analytically.
- Grid visualization no longer uses a texture.
- Material documentation update.

### Removed

- Hex grid texture.
- Hex grid offsets texture.
- Unused *Feature* material.

## [2.1.0] - 2022-12-28

### Added

- Code documentation for top-level public types and public members.

### Changed

- Upgraded to Unity 2021.3.16f1.
- Public configuration fields are now private serializable.
- Non-static public fields that are referenced outside their containing classes have become properties.
- `HexFeatureCollection` has become a nested type inside `HexFeatureManager`.
- Default map has wrapping disabled, as it makes no sense for small maps.

### Fixed

- Units are no longer selectable in edit mode on startup, so no more unwanted pathfinding while editing.

### Added

- Dependency on Universal RP package version 12.1.7 and created URP assets.
- URP package dependencies, Burst updated to version 1.8.1 and Mathematics to 1.2.6.

- Expanded README file.

### Removed

- Surface shaders for all terrain, water, and feature materials.
- All CGINC files.
